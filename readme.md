# statxplorer

statxplorer is an R package for downloading data from the Department for Work and Pensions [Stat-Xplore](https://stat-xplore.dwp.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/login.xhtml) API. 

The package supports a workflow where custom queries can be designed and downloaded from the Stat-Xplore web interface or written by hand and then used to fetch the tables from the API as tibbles. This package currently only uses the table endpoint of the API.

This is currently work in progess.
